      <H2>NEW RECRUITS</H2>
      <Spacer size={10} />
      <Text>We play super fun, competitive games in North Hollywood and Sherman Oaks, Monday Nights, Wednesday Nights, and Saturday morning. 8-10pm weeknights, Sat 8-10am (adding another game very soon). Costs $7.50 a night. Or $65 for a 10 night bundle. $120 for 20 nights. First night out is on the house... that's how i get cha! I'm always looking to recruit fresh blood as I'm forming an exploratory committee to maybe, potentially, open my own pick-up gym some day. So please feel free to spread the word to anyone you have in mind. Mondays and Wednesdays can be really full because of guys that pay to have access for those specific games. Payers or "A Listers" guys pay annual fees for the Monday and Wednesday games, and they get guaranteed spots. 'Pay to Players' or "B Listers" simply pay as they go, are first come first served. </Text>

      <H2>GAME RULES FOR ALL</H2>
      <Spacer size={10} />
      <Text>Offense calls their own fouls. But defense is more then encouraged to call them too. But if you don't call it, and the action goes the other way... you ain't getting it. you have to speak up. Games are to 17 by 2's and 3's. Some nights we can barely squeeze in our pre-designed 6 games. Other nights we can get 8-9 games. Depends on the shooting. Depends on the tenacity of the Defense. We also have a 20 minute limit. This is just in case games go too long, nobody should have to sit on the sidelines longer then 20 minutes. Plus, the outcomes are arbitrary, so we'll just call a time limit game a tie. We play minimum 6 games a night. each team will play 4 games. In a round robin fashion. After that, it's considered "Bonus Games". Guys can leave if they choose, or we just keep the rotations going, and we can mix up the teams at that point. But if you are in a night with 15 guys and 3 teams, you are counted on to play 4 full games. Check in is from the center court circle. No Handoffs. You may in-bound balls quickly that go out on the baseline. If they go out on the sidelines, We in-bound at half court. Yes, we play backcourt. Over the backboard without touching anything is in play. if the ball touches wires or backboard support irons, then it's out. You are encouraged to count 3 seconds on offensive players camping in the paint. I encourage people to stop action without actually calling a foul to point out a bad pick or a dirty play. it doesn't always have to be an foul or infraction to stop play. we aren't always trying to call an "offensive foul" or something silly like an "illegal screen" during a pick-up game... but we should just stop play and help somebody better understand the rules. It'll make the game cleaner and funner in the long run. And people won't build up resentment for someone always setting dirty screens. Talk it out like men, please. Honestly, it'll help the good times roll.</Text>

      <H2>COMMISH RULES</H2>
      <Spacer size={10} />
      <Text>I have a strict, NO HACKERS, JACKERS, OR SLACKERS policy. (copyright pending) Hackers is pretty obvious. don't foul every damn possession. sometimes people get beat, and you have to tip your cap. don't make hard fouls. we are all old men trying to get a good fun run in. we're not trying to hurt each other.Jackers... simple. don't shoot too much. new guys coming in definitely need to learn their teammates and learn their roles. we all share the ball. even our "worst" players can knock down open looks if you don't defend them. ball hogs are for the street games. I won't put up with that style of play. Slackers... we all need a breather every now and then. just don't do it on defense and then end up cherry picking on offense. no hard rules against cherry picking... other then just, it's not real basketball. So we don't play that way. We don't argue. We don't fight over calls. ok, well, of course we do. but we curb it. if necessary, we go to the jump ball and just trade the make believe possession arrow. There are a lot of 50/50 calls during the game that people fight passionately about, that should simply be jump balls. It's not worth it, and nobody is keeping track of wins and loses. true story.  I also encourage calling Bullshit on people who make bad calls. we very frequently "respect the call", but that doesn't mean we can't tell them a call is weak. they can have the call and the ball, but they aren't going to learn any better if we don't mention, "hey you know that call was weak right?". takes a village... help each other learn.</Text>

      <H2>ACCOUNTABILITY</H2>
      <Spacer size={10} />
      <Text>We play 15 guys a night (most nights). 3 even teams of 5. Here's the thing about playing with set teams... we count on each other. We count on guys to play when they say they are gonna play. We're all busy humans with jobs and families. I personally have a 5 year old and a 1.5 year old at home. We should be able to know if we have a potential late night at work coming up. I can NOT stress enough...  "No call No shows", are completely unacceptable. If you have a conflict... just talk to me about it and we'll work it out. It's like a gym membership. You come play when you can. I take care of the rest. No waiting 8 games on the sidelines like 24 Hour Fitness. No 4 guys showing up one night, 10 the next, like in a league.</Text>

      <H2>A LITTLE ABOUT COMMISH</H2>
      <Spacer size={10} />
      <Text>After 4 years at Villanova (before they were good), I took my talents overseas. I've played in China with Starbury, Isreal with Kenyon Martin, Then eventually got called up the the NBDL. Almost made it. Nah, i'm playing. I'm just an outta shape 5'9" white boy with hoop dreams like everyone else. Just turned 40 years old. So now i stack the teams in my favor so i can pretend i'm really good. For my day job, i'm a television editor and producer. Been doing it in LA since 2001 when i moved here from Philly/SouthJersey. I've worked freelance ever since. That's where i meet a lot of our ballers, going from job to job and trying to recruit along the way. So we have a lot of production people in our crew. I've been running games since 2010, and started adding more then one game and guys to the run in 2015. the point to all this rambling is... we have a really fun games. particularly because I "Commish" the shit out of it. people have been kicked out for being overly sour out there. never thinking the ball goes out on them. for just being dicks. don't be a dick. play hard. have fun. and we'll all get along famously.  this is a private club... and eviction can be made at any time. And i'm more then happy to make refunds. one guy recently got the boot for mixing it up too often, with too many people. Almost getting in fights regularly. He was not a good team player. We just want nice dudes out there. You don't have to want to invite everyone over for tea and crumpets, but you shouldn't be nearly fighting out there over a game. Playing ball is my workout time. it's my bro hang time with the boys. it's my chatting sports on the sidelines between games time. it's fun. come be a part of it. </Text>
